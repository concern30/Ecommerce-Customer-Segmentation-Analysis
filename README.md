üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project was to perform a complete, end-to-end analysis of a real-world e-commerce dataset. The objective was to use data-driven techniques to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, and then translate these findings into actionable marketing strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python: Pandas (for data manipulation), Scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering)

Visualization: Tableau Public

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

üí° What I Learned & Skills Demonstrated
This project served as a practical exercise in the core lifecycle of a data analysis project, solidifying my skills in:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Systematically handled a messy, real-world dataset by addressing missing values, correcting complex datetime formats, and filtering out noise to create a reliable foundation for analysis.

Machine Learning for Analytics: Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm, a fundamental unsupervised machine learning technique, to automatically group over 4,000 customers into four distinct segments based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores.

Data Visualization & Storytelling: Communicated complex analytical results by building a clear, interactive, and easy-to-understand dashboard in Tableau that tells a compelling story.

Business Acumen: Translated technical findings into strategic business recommendations, demonstrating an ability to connect data analysis to real-world business impact.

üìà Key Findings & Recommendations
The analysis successfully identified four key customer segments:

Champions (High-Value): A small but highly valuable group of recent, frequent, and high-spending customers.

Recommendation: Launch an exclusive VIP loyalty program for this segment.

Loyalists (At-Risk): Customers who were previously valuable but haven't purchased in a while.

Recommendation: Target this segment with a personalized "We Miss You" re-engagement email campaign.

New & Promising: Recent customers with low frequency and monetary value.

Recommendation: Nurture this group with a welcome email series to encourage a second purchase.

Low-Engagement: A large group of customers who purchase infrequently and spend very little.

Recommendation: Keep in general email newsletters, but focus primary marketing resources on more valuable segments.

üíª How to Run This Project
Data Source: The original and cleaned CSV files for this project are hosted on Kaggle due to their size.

Code: The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) in this repository contains all the Python code used for the data preparation and segmentation.

Visualization: The final interactive dashboard can be viewed live via the Tableau Public link at the top of this README.
